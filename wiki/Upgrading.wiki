#summary Upgrade instructions for production users

Revisions listed here will introduce a backwards incompatible change in the data model.  If you don't have any production data in django-crm (formerly minibooks) you can ignore these instructions and simply drop and recreate your database.

= r11 =

To successfully upgrade past r11, you need to complete the following steps:

 # svn up -r11
 # ./manage.py syncdb
 # ./manage.py dbshell < apps/external_apps/crm/migrations/001_locations.sql
 # ./manage.py migrate_crm_data
 # svn up

r11 is a "special" state of the code in which both models for storing address/phone info exist.  They will be removed in a future revision, making your old data inaccessible if you don't go through this step.  Please create a ticket if you have any questions.

= r18 =

To successfully upgrade past r18, you must first complete the r11 upgrade (if need be) and then complete the following steps:

 # svn up -r18
 # ./manage.py syncdb
 # ./manage.py migrate_crm_data
 # ./manage.py dbshell < apps/external_apps/crm/migrations/004_business.sql
 # svn up
